# ⭐ Week-4 Step-2: Performance Profiling (CPU & Memory)

## ⭐ Objective

To analyze **CPU and memory usage** of the application during runtime and verify that the system operates efficiently without excessive resource consumption.

---

## ⭐ Important Tool Used

* **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** – command-line profiling (used because VS Code does not provide Android Profiler UI like Android Studio).

---

## ⭐ Step-by-Step Procedure

### ⭐ Step-1: Connect Device

Ensure your mobile device is connected and detected:

```bash
adb devices
```

---

### ⭐ Step-2: Run Application

Launch the app on the physical device and perform actions such as:

* Voice command
* App opening
* Background processing

---

### ⭐ Step-3: Capture CPU & Memory Usage

Execute the profiling command:

```bash
adb shell top -n 1 | findstr com.example
```

---

## ⭐ Output Observed (Verified)

```text
15609 u0_a407      20   0 6.6G 255M 152M S 14.7   4.5   0:06.13 com.example
```

## ⭐ Output Analysis (Very Important)

| ⭐ Parameter     | ⭐ Value      | ⭐ Explanation                    |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| ⭐ Process Name  | com.example  | Application package              |
| ⭐ CPU Usage     | **14.7%**    | Temporary spike during execution |
| ⭐ Memory Usage  | **255 MB**   | Stable runtime memory            |
| ⭐ Process State | S (Sleeping) | App returns to idle              |
| ⭐ CPU Time      | 0:06.13      | Low processing time              |

---

## ⭐ Key Observations

* ⭐ CPU usage **spikes only during command execution**
* ⭐ No continuous background CPU consumption
* ⭐ Memory remains stable (no leaks)
* ⭐ App returns to idle state after processing

---

## ⭐ Conclusion

The application demonstrates **efficient CPU and memory utilization**. Performance profiling confirms that the system executes AI tasks only when required and does not consume unnecessary background resources, fulfilling the **performance optimization goal of Week-4**.
