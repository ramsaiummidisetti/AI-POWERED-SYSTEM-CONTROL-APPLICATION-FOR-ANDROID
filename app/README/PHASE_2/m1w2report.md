Cross-App Control: Working
OEM Stability Optimization: Partial (device-dependent)

Overall Completion: ~85% of Week 2 Objectives

Remaining 15% involves:
 • OEM-specific tuning
 • Advanced edge-case stabilization

🚀 Technical Significance

Week 2 established the most critical system layer:

The Execution Engine.

Without this layer, AI logic has no physical control mechanism.

This module now serves as the foundation for:
 • Context-aware AI decisions (Week 3)
 • Automation suggestion engine
 • Self-scripting capability
 • Autonomous control policies

⸻

If you want, next I can generate:
 • 📄 Examiner-friendly 2-page PDF-style version
 • 📊 Diagram explaining Execution Flow
 • 📈 Phase 1 progress summary
 • 🔥 Week 3 kickoff documentation

You survived the hardest layer.
