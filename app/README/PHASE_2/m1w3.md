Perfect — this is a **new phase (Week-3)** and it is **clearly different from Week-1 & Week-2**.
I’ll explain **what Week-3 really means**, **what you must build**, **where code will go**, and **how it fits your existing project**.

# 📅 Week 3: Autonomy and Self-Scripting

## 🎯 Goal (In Simple Words)

Your app should **observe user behavior**, **detect repeated patterns**, and then:

1. **Suggest automations**
2. **Create shortcuts automatically**
3. **Allow natural language task scripts**

👉 Example:

* User opens **YouTube → Chrome → Wi-Fi** every night
  → App suggests:

> “Do you want me to automate your night routine?”

---

## 🧠 What “Autonomy & Self-Scripting” Means

### 1️⃣ Autonomy

The app **acts intelligently without explicit commands every time**.

✔ Learns habits
✔ Detects repetition
✔ Suggests actions
✔ Reduces user effort

---

### 2️⃣ Self-Scripting

The app converts **natural language → executable workflow**.

Example:

> “When battery is low, turn on battery saver and close apps”

Internally becomes:

```
IF battery < 20%
→ enable battery saver
→ close background apps
```

## 📘 Learning Outcomes (What You’ll Demonstrate)

| Skill               | How you show it            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Pattern detection   | UsageStatsManager analysis |
| AI workflows        | Rule-based + ML logic      |
| NLP scripting       | Parsing user sentences     |
| Automation          | Chained actions            |
| System intelligence | Suggestions                |

## 🧩 Week-3 Architecture (Fits Your Project)

```
UsageStatsManager
      ↓
UsageAnalyzer
      ↓
PatternDetector
      ↓
AutomationSuggester
      ↓
User Confirmation
      ↓
ScriptEngine
      ↓
CommandOrchestrator

✔ Uses your existing:

* `CommandOrchestrator`
* `UniversalControlService`
* `VoiceHelper`
* `MainActivity`

---

## 🧱 STEP-BY-STEP WEEK-3 PLAN

---

## 🔹 STEP 1: UsageStats Collection

**(Foundation of Week-3)**

### 📂 File

```
com.example.utils.UsagePatternAnalyzer.java
```

### Uses

* `UsageStatsManager`
* Detect:

  * Most used apps
  * Time-based patterns
  * Repeated sequences

### Example Output

```
YouTube → Chrome → Settings (Daily at 10 PM)
```

---

## 🔹 STEP 2: Pattern Detection Logic

### 📂 File

```
com.example.ai.PatternDetector.java
```

### What it does

* Checks:

  * Same app order
  * Same time window
  * Repeated ≥ 3 times

✔ No heavy ML yet (rule-based = acceptable for academics)

---

## 🔹 STEP 3: Automation Suggestion Engine

### 📂 File

```
com.example.ai.AutomationSuggester.java
```

### Example Suggestion

> “You often open YouTube and enable Wi-Fi at night.
> Do you want me to automate this?”

Uses:

* Toast
* Voice
* Dialog

---

## 🔹 STEP 4: Natural Language Task Scripting

### 📂 File

```
com.example.ai.TaskScriptParser.java
```

### Input

> “When I open YouTube, turn on Wi-Fi and disable Bluetooth”

### Parsed Script

```json
{
  "trigger": "youtube_open",
  "actions": ["wifi_on", "bluetooth_off"]
}
```

---

## 🔹 STEP 5: Script Execution Engine

### 📂 File

```
com.example.ai.ScriptEngine.java
```

### Uses

* `CommandOrchestrator`
* `UniversalControlService`

Executes **multi-step workflows**

---

## 🔹 STEP 6: Shortcut Storage (Self-Learning)

### 📂 Storage

```
SharedPreferences / JSON
```

Saves:

* User-approved scripts
* Learned shortcuts
* Context triggers

---

## 🔹 STEP 7: Voice + UI Integration

User can say:

* “Show my automations”
* “Delete night routine”
* “Create a shortcut”

Handled in:

* `MainActivity`
* `AIIntentEngine` (new intents)

---

## 🔹 STEP 8: Verification & Logs (Important for Viva)

### Test Commands

```bash
adb logcat | findstr AUTO
adb logcat | findstr PATTERN
adb logcat | findstr SCRIPT
```

### Expected Logs

```
Pattern detected: YouTube nightly usage
Automation suggested
User accepted automation
Script saved
```

---

## 📌 Is Week-3 Part of Roadmap?

### ✅ YES — fully aligned

| Roadmap Line      | Implemented By               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Autonomy          | Pattern detection            |
| Self-scripting    | TaskScriptParser             |
| UsageStatsManager | UsagePatternAnalyzer         |
| AI workflows      | ScriptEngine                 |
| Automation        | Orchestrator + Accessibility |

---

## 📄 What You Can Upload After Week-3

* Week-3 README
* Code screenshots
* Log evidence
* Demo video
* GitHub tags

---

## 🔜 Next Action (You choose)

Say **one** of these:

1. **“Start Step-1 implementation”**
2. **“Prepare Week-3 folder structure”**
3. **“Week-3 README template”**
4. **“Week-3 Viva answers”**

You are now entering the **AI-core phase** of your project 🚀
